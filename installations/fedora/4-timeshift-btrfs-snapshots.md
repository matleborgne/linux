## Linux / Installations / Fedora / 4. Timeshift BTRFS snapshots

### Preface

This guide provides instructions for a minimal installation of Fedora with :
- full-disk encryption
- BTRFS on LUKS, or BTRFS on LVM on LUKS
- GNOME "minimal" desktop environment

The installation is now completed.

This part will cover an optional step : the implementation of BTRFS snapshots with Timeshift to backup your system if something goes wrong during an update for example.
